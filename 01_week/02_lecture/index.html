    <p>
      This Full-Stack Web Development course using the MERN Stack offers a
      comprehensive learning path from the basics to advanced topics. Starting
      with an introduction to full-stack development and the components of the
      MERN stack, the course delves deeply into each technology. Students will
      learn to perform CRUD operations with MongoDB, build RESTful APIs using
      Express.js, create dynamic user interfaces with React.js, and manage
      servers with Node.js. The course emphasizes hands-on learning through a
      capstone project, where students build a real-world application,
      integrating all the learned concepts. This structure ensures that learners
      are well-prepared to handle real-world full-stack development challenges.
