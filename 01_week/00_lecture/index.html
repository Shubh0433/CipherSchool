      Full-Stack Development using the MERN Stack is a contemporary approach to
      creating web applications. MERN stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React.js,
      and Node.js. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible,
      JSON-like documents. Express.js is a web application framework for
      Node.js, designed to build robust APIs. React.js is a JavaScript library
      for constructing user interfaces, particularly single-page applications.
      Node.js is a server-side platform built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
      Together, these technologies offer a seamless development experience,
      enabling developers to use JavaScript across the entire stack. This stack
      is ideal for developing scalable, high-performance web applications. Its
      modularity and open-source nature contribute to its popularity and
      extensive community support. Additionally, the MERN stack facilitates
      rapid development and deployment, making it a preferred choice for both
      startups and large enterprises.
